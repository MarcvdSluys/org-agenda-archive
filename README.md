# org-agenda-archive #

A command-line tool written in Python to archive your emacs orgmode agenda items for a certain year.  The
selected items are archived in a different file with the same headings tree structure.  The rest are kept in a
third (cleaned) file.  Most work is done by the [orgparse](https://github.com/karlicoss/orgparse) package by
Karlicoss.
